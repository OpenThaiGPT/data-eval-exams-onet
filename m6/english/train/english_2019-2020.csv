Equipment:  A couple of soft towels, a sponge, a wash

the bath. Moisten the wash cloth and apply soap, first to the face and neck,then to the arms, next

over the face, arms, body and legs, repeating this until all dirt and soap are removed. Dry by

genesis of a snowflake requires fairly slow and continuous crystallization
with little turbulence. If the wind continues to carry clouds toward high
ground, or if a warm air mass slides smoothly over a cold one, snow can

isolated, unstable cumulonimbus clouds where there is very strong internal
circulation, Mosthailstones have a layered structure, showing that they

2019,75,"What is it about loud rock music that makes your ears ring after several hours at a concert or club? Does loud classical music have the same effect? Ringing in the ears is called tinnitus. In the circumstances described above, it can often be accompanied by a temporary loss of hearing known as (line 5) temporary threshold shift and indicates damage to the nerves of the inner ear caused by excessive noise exposure. The criterion is not the type of music listened to but the sound energy involved. Rock music, being prone to electric amplification, can generate high noise levels.

(line 10) Repeated exposure to high noise levels can lead to permanent and irreversible hearing damage, and because of this, noise in the workplace is subject to legislation, the maximum permitted exposure level being 90 dBA over an eight-hour shift.
